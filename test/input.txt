Hello, it's Raye here
Please get nice and comfortable
And lock your phones
Because the story is about to begin, uh
Ladies and gentlemen
I'm gonna tell you 'bout
One of the many men
Name is irrelevant
Height is irrelevant
He was a one out of ten
I wish that I knew it then
I'm still recovering, uh
Truly, I'm vulnerable
I love a sentiment
Quickly, I opened up
I learned my lesson then
Thought I was safe again
Thought he was innocent
I was so wrong
I can't deny
I was stuck in a daze
Terrible phase
You was convincing though
Very believable
The role that you played
So, I'll take
This front row seat
And baby, baby
You can go ahead
Cry those
Oscar winning tears
Pop corn and I scream
Baby, baby
You can go ahead
Cry those
Oscar winning tears, baby
Oh, what a tragedy
It didn't have to be
Look how you talk to me
Cursing and blasphemy
Cinematography
Get this on camera please
Or no one's gon' believe this here
I can't deny, I thought
You were the man
But you had a plan
The **** are you lying for
**** are you crying for
You did it again, yeah
So, I’ll take
This front row seat
And baby, baby
You can go ahead
Cry those
Oscar winning tears
Pop corn and I scream
Baby, baby
You can go ahead
Cry those
Oscar winning
Tears (Tears)
Tears, cry them
You can miss me with the bullshit
I can see right through your
Tears (Tears, cry them) (Tears)
Tears, cry them
9 o'clock entertainment
Oh man, I wish I could tape it
Sit down
No tissues
No string section
No tiny violin
For the last time, I'm your audience
I'll take, this front row seat
And baby, baby, you can go
Ahead and cry those
Baby
And baby, baby, baby
Would you really go ahead and
Would you go ahead and just cry?
Cry, cry, cry, cry those
Oscar, winning
Tears, baby
Go ahead, cry those
Oscar winning
And after his Oscar winning performance
I left the room and never saw him again
